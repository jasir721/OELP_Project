### Introduction :-
Video content analysis is one new technology which uses computer vision
and in general different deep learning models. It is used for automatically
identifying different events in the videos , monitor video streams in real
Time and then extract useful information . This is mainly used in the field of sports,transport,security etc. For security purposes, cameras can be installed in different places and then detect different anomalies. In the sports field, coaches could find the weak point of their opponent and moreover find the technical mistakes made by their own player. 

### Aim of the Project
In this project, we will devise a fast learning algorithm which will be able to learn from analyzing video frames to recognize the player's behavior and techniques and then use that information to give suggestions to improve his/her skills and give suggestions for the areas that the player needs to work upon. These results will aid athletes in identifying and correcting their frequent errors as well as modifying their technique if necessary to achieve better results.
